# **VPN and Malicious Network Request Classifier Using AI**

## **Project OverviewðŸš€**
This project applies machine learning and AI techniques to classify VPN traffic and identify malicious network requests. It utilizes **time-based flow features** such as `flowBytesPerSecond` and `flowPktsPerSecond` to distinguish between:
- **VPN vs. Non-VPN** traffic
- **Malicious vs. Normal** network flows

The project emphasizes data-driven insights using robust visualizations and automated file management for traffic datasets.

## **Key Features**

1. **Traffic Classification**:
   - Uses time-related flow-based features for high-accuracy traffic classification.
   - Two primary tasks:
     - **VPN Detection**: Distinguishes VPN from non-VPN flows.
     - **Malicious Detection**: Identifies malicious network requests based on file types.

2. **Advanced Visualizations**:
   - Generates the following for deeper traffic insights:
     - **eCDF Plots**: Empirical Cumulative Distribution of flow features.
     - **Heatmaps**: Correlation between flow features for VPN and non-VPN.
     - **Scatter Plots**: Relationship between `flowBytesPerSecond` and `flowPktsPerSecond`.

3. **Automated Dataset Management**:
   - Downloads, extracts, and organizes VPN datasets from ISCX repositories.
   - Processes test cases and classifies files into `normal` and `malicious` folders.

4. **Concurrent Processing**:
   - Speeds up file classification using **ThreadPoolExecutor**.

## **Visualizations**

### **1. eCDF Plot**  
The eCDF plot compares the empirical cumulative distribution of `flowBytesPerSecond` for VPN and Non-VPN traffic:

![eCDF Plot](graphs/TimeBasedFeatures-Dataset-15s-VPN_ecdf.png)

**Observations**:
- The majority of data flows are concentrated at lower byte rates for both VPN and non-VPN users.
- Some outliers suggest significantly higher flow rates for non-VPN traffic.

---

### **2. Heatmaps**  
Heatmaps show the correlation between `flowBytesPerSecond` and `flowPktsPerSecond` for both VPN and non-VPN traffic:

![Heatmaps](graphs/TimeBasedFeatures-Dataset-15s-VPN_heatmap.png)

**Observations**:
- VPN users exhibit a stronger correlation (~0.8) between the two features.
- Non-VPN traffic has a lower correlation (~0.31), suggesting more variability in flow behavior.

---

### **3. Scatter Plots**  
Scatter plots depict the relationship between `flowBytesPerSecond` and `flowPktsPerSecond` for VPN and non-VPN traffic:

**Observations**:
- VPN traffic clusters tightly at lower values.
- Non-VPN traffic shows more scattered outliers with significantly higher flow rates.

## **Machine Learning Models**
The project utilizes the following models for classification:
1. **C4.5 Decision Tree**:
   - High accuracy and explainability with tree-structured outputs.
   - Outperforms KNN slightly in precision and recall.

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:
   - Simple and effective for flow-based classification.
   - Useful for comparative analysis.

---

## **Key Findings**

1. **Time-based Flow Features**:
   - Features like `flowBytesPerSecond` and `flowPktsPerSecond` are effective for distinguishing VPN and non-VPN traffic.

2. **Shorter Flow Timeouts Improve Accuracy**:
   - Classifiers perform better with shorter flow durations (15s timeout) as opposed to longer durations (120s).

3. **Visual Insights**:
   - **Heatmaps** reveal stronger feature correlations in VPN traffic.
   - **Scatter Plots** highlight differences in flow behavior between VPN and non-VPN users.

---

## **Future Work**
- Integrate additional classifiers such as **Random Forest** and **SVM**.
- Develop real-time traffic analysis for live network data.
- Explore more flow features to improve malicious traffic detection.
